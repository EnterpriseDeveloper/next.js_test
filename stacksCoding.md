## Prompt

* Download Hiro wallet and create an account.
* Using the Microstacks template, build a Next.js page with wallet login.
* Call the Faucet endpoint on the stacks API using your new wallet testnet address as an argument, to receive testnet STX (feel free to use Postman for this).
* Create a table that displays all transactions and their states when a user has authenticated with their wallet.
* Use websockets to update the states of transactions in the transaction table from pending state to confirmed.

NOTE: Stacks blocks take about 10 min to propagate, so transactions will be pending for around this time after called.
